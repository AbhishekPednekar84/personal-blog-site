[Code Disciples](https://www.codedisciples.in) is a blog for all things code. The internet is vast and is full of great content and mostly awesome folks who are always willing to help. However, sometimes, we run into a real frustrating issue that we are unable to resolve even after rummaging through heaps of documentation or tutorials. It's not that the information did not exist, it's just that we did not look in all the right places. Most blogs on the site stem from such painful moments of frustration. Conversely, there are times when you come across something cool or interesting that you simply want to share. Some posts fall under this category as well.
